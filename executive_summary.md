# Partner Lifecycle Data & Process Platform

**(Onboarding → Run/Integration → Offboarding)**

## 1. Executive Summary

We are standardizing Digital Alliance partner management on a **single ontology-driven source of truth** inside Palantir Foundry.  
This delivers:

- **One place to see status** of every partner, model, and integration case.
    
- **Automated dashboards & KPIs** for business owners—no more manual slide decks.
    
- **Actionable workflows** (approve gates, close risks, revoke access) directly in Foundry.
    
- **AIP-powered copilots/agents** to query status, draft communications, and validate process compliance.
    

Result: Faster, safer partner activations and deactivations, clearer accountability, and auditable governance.

## 2. Business Value & Benefits

|Benefit|What It Means for Business Owners|
|---|---|
|**Transparency**|Real-time visibility into onboarding/offboarding progress, integration health, and SLA adherence.|
|**Consistency**|Standardized steps, roles (RACI), and tools reduces rework and ambiguity.|
|**Speed & Efficiency**|Automated KPIs, generated checklists, and in-tool actions shorten cycle times.|
|**Risk Reduction**|Built-in governance (security, export control), automated access teardown, and risk tracking.|
|**Scalability**|Ontology model lets us add new partners/models/tools without rewriting documents and dashboards.|
|**LLM Assistance (AIP)**|Conversational access to status, “what’s blocking Case X?”, or “generate the offboarding report” with citations.|

---

## 3. Ontology: The Core Model

We model the lifecycle as **objects (entities)** and **links (relationships)**. Everything in our dashboards, checklists, and automations references these objects.

### 3.1 Core Objects (Top Level)

- **Partner** – external organization in the Digital Alliance.
    
- **Phase** – Onboarding, Enablement/Run, Offboarding (lifecycle stages).
    
- **Step** – atomic actions in each phase (IP Whitelisting, Access Revocation, etc.).
    
- **Role / Person** – who is Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed (RACI).
    
- **Tool** – DA / Foundry / security tools used in steps.
    
- **Environment & AccessObject** – Foundry spaces, IP ranges, groups, permissions.
    
- **IntegrationCase** – the Airbus Model Integration team’s “case file” per model/environment.
    
- **IntegrationTask, ApprovalGate, ValidationResult, RiskIssue, Artifact** – detailed execution layer.
    
- **ModelWork / ModelVersion / Experiment / Dataset / MetricSet** – for model development & validation in run mode.
    
- **Policy / ChecklistItem** – governance, compliance, and optional task lists.
    

### 3.2 Key Relationships (Examples)

- `Partner undergoesPhase Phase`
    
- `Phase hasStep Step` (ordered by `precedes`)
    
- `Step performedBy Role` and `Step requiresTool Tool`
    
- `IntegrationCase hasTask IntegrationTask`
    
- `IntegrationCase hasRisk RiskIssue`, `hasGate ApprovalGate`, `hasValidation ValidationResult`
    
- `ModelWork hasVersion ModelVersion` → `ModelVersion hasExperiment Experiment` → `Experiment producedMetrics MetricSet`
    

> **Outcome:** From these links we can automatically generate:
> 
> - RACI matrices, process diagrams, tool matrices, checklists
>     
> - Dashboards showing status/task/gate/risk rollups
>

## 5. KPIs & Dashboards

### 5.1 Key KPIs

- **Tasks Done % / Blocked Count**
    
- **Gate Pass Rate** (approved vs total)
    
- **Schedule Variance** (planned vs actual end dates)
    
- **Open Risks (High/Med/Low)**
    
- **On-Time Delivery %** across portfolio
    

### 5.2 Core Dashboards (Workshop)

1. **Portfolio Overview**
    
    - Filters (Partner, Env, Phase, Status)
        
    - KPI tiles, Gantt/timeline, Cases table, Risk heatmap
        
2. **IntegrationCase Detail**
    
    - Header card (SLA, owner, status)
        
    - Timeline & gate progress tracker
        
    - Task Kanban/table with inline actions
        
    - Risk & Validation sections
        
    - Artifact/evidence list
        
3. **Risk & SLA Monitor**
    
    - Heatmap of risks by severity & case
        
    - SLA breach list and trends
        

(See previous mockups for component-by-component layouts.)

## 6. Workflow & Actions

We embed **Actions** directly in the ontology so users can update state without leaving the dashboard.

**Examples:**

- **CloseCase** – set status=Complete, actualEnd; triggers KPI refresh.
    
- **MarkTaskDone / MarkTaskBlocked** – task updates with timestamps.
    
- **ApproveGate** – record decision, date, comments; recalc KPIs.
    
- **EscalateRisk** – notify business owners via Slack/Email, log escalation time.
    
- **BlacklistIP / RevokeAccess** – write back to AccessObject and trigger downstream scripts.
    

Actions can have:

- **Visibility rules** (only show when appropriate).
    
- **Input forms** (date, comment).
    
- **Handlers** (Python/Logic to send notifications or execute tech steps).
    
- **Post-actions** (kick off transforms, alerts).

## 7. Implementation Strategy & Plan

### Phase 0 – Alignment & Design (2–3 weeks)

- Finalize ontology schema & naming (Partner, Step, IntegrationCase, etc.).
    
- Agree on KPIs, enums, and required properties.
    
- Identify data sources (existing spreadsheets, QG console exports, MOCA, Jira).
    

**Deliverables:** Signed-off ontology diagram, property dictionary, data-mapping doc.

### Phase 1 – MVP Build (4–6 weeks)

- Implement ontology in Foundry (Object Types + Links).
    
- Ingest initial data for a subset of partners/cases (“lighthouse cohort”).
    
- Build KPI transforms (Code Workbook/Pipeline Builder).
    
- Create Portfolio Overview and Case Detail dashboards (Workshop).
    
- Add core Actions (CloseCase, MarkTaskDone, ApproveGate).
    

**Deliverables:** Live MVP dashboards, working actions, first KPI dataset.

### Phase 2 – Expansion & Automation (4–8 weeks)

- Add Risk board, SLA monitoring, and automated alerts.
    
- Integrate Access revocation/IP blacklisting scripts as Actions.
    
- Build status history logging for “time in status” KPIs.
    
- Onboard more partner teams and models.
    

**Deliverables:** Full portfolio coverage, automated governance checks.

### Phase 3 – AIP Enablement (4–6 weeks)

- **Agent Studio Bot:** “Integration Copilot” – asks: “What’s blocking Case IC-2025-034?” “List open risks for GE this month.”
    
- **LLM-based report generator:** Auto-create monthly executive summaries, meeting packs.
    
- **AIP Logic:** Validate partner steps against checklist; flag missing artifacts.
    

**Deliverables:** Deployed AIP agent(s), prompt library, governance guardrails (prompt templates + retrieval).

### Phase 4 – Sustainment & Continuous Improvement (ongoing)

- Version and evolve ontology (add new gates/tools/roles).
    
- Expand automation (auto-close stale tasks, auto-create risks on missed SLAs).
    
- Periodic reviews with business owners.
    

---

## 8. Governance & Compliance

- **Versioning:** Semantic versions on ontology (schema) vs data (instances).
    
- **Validation Rules:**
    
    - Every Step must have a Responsible role.
        
    - Offboarding Step set must contain Access revocation and IP blacklisting.
        
    - Sensitive datasets must link to a Policy.
        
- **Audit Trail:** Actions write to history tables; artifacts stored with checksums/URIs.
    
- **Access Control:** Foundry object-level security ensures partners see only their data.

## 9. Leveraging AIP (Palantir AI Platform)

**Use Cases:**

1. **Natural-Language Status Queries**
    
    - “Show all integration cases at risk of missing SLA this month.”
        
    - “Summarize the onboarding steps completed for Partner X and remaining gaps.”
        
2. **Guided Workflows / “Explain this step”**
    
    - Agent surfaces the relevant Step definition, required Tool, and RACI info from ontology.
        
3. **Automated Documents**
    
    - Generate onboarding/offboarding reports, risk summaries, and checklists as Word/PDF with citations to ontology objects.
        
4. **Proactive Alerts**
    
    - AIP monitors KPIs; triggers agent to message owners when thresholds exceeded.
        

**Implementation Tips:**

- Use **AIP Logic** to create LLM transforms that read the ontology and craft responses with context windows.
    
- Use **Agent Studio** to define a Partner Lifecycle Agent:
    
    - Tools: Ontology query function, KPI dataset search, action trigger function.
        
    - Guardrails: Prompt templates that enforce citation (object IDs), no hallucinations.
        
- For “write” operations (closing tasks, approving gates), route through ontology Actions to keep auditability.
