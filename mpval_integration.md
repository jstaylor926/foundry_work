You’re on the right track—your existing schema already models most of the pieces you need (the case, its tasks, gates and artifacts). However, the *act* of “requesting validation” and the *admin’s* ability to pick up that request and actually push the model into the validation environment is really a **behavior** or **workflow event**, not just static data. To capture it cleanly, I’d recommend layering in one of the following (or both):

---

## 1. Leverage an IntegrationGate

You already have an `IntegrationGate` object type. You can define a specific gate—say, **“Validation Requested”**—and then an accompanying **“Validation Pushed”** gate.

1. **Add new gate names** to your enum in `IntegrationGate` (e.g. `ValidationRequested`, `ValidationPushed`).
2. Whenever someone clicks “Request Validation,” you ingest or create a new `IntegrationGate` instance with

   ```yaml
   gateId: G-003  
   name: ValidationRequested  
   status: Pending  
   caseRef: <CASE‑ID>
   approver: jdoe@example.com 
   gateDate: <today>
   ```
3. When the admin actually pushes to validation, they update that same gate (or create the next) to

   ```yaml
   status: Passed  
   gateDate: <timestamp of push>  
   approver: admin@example.com
   ```

That way you get a full audit trail of *when* validation was requested and *when* it actually went live.

---

## 2. Introduce a ValidationRequest Action Type

If you’d rather model this as an *action* rather than a gate, you can define a new Action Type in your ontology:

```yaml
# Filename: request_validation_action.yml
actionType: yourns.RequestValidation
label: Request Validation
description: |
  Represents a user’s request to push a model into the Validation environment.

properties:
  - name: requestId
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Unique key for this validation request.
  - name: requestedOn
    type: datetime
    required: true
    description: When the request was made.
  - name: requestedBy
    type: string
    description: User who submitted the request.
  - name: status
    type: string
    enum: [Pending, Approved, Rejected]
    required: true
  - name: processedOn
    type: datetime
    description: When the request was acted upon.
  - name: processedBy
    type: string
    description: Admin who processed the request.

links:
  - name: caseRef
    targetType: yourns.IntegrationCase
    cardinality: ONE
  - name: modelRef
    targetType: yourns.ModelVersion
    cardinality: ONE
```

**Workflow**

1. User “submits” a `RequestValidation` action (status=Pending).
2. Admin sees all `RequestValidation` actions in Pending, approves one (status→Approved) and perhaps triggers a downstream pipeline.
3. You can even attach a post‑approval action (e.g. kick off an automated schedule build) via an **Action Handler** in Foundry.

---

### Which to Choose?

* **IntegrationGate approach** is more lightweight if you view “validation” simply as another process milestone.
* **ActionType approach** gives you richer metadata around the request itself (comments, rejection reasons, escalation, etc.).

You could even combine them: approving the `RequestValidation` action could auto‑create or update the `IntegrationGate(name=ValidationPushed)` entry.

---

**Next step**
Let me know which pattern you’d prefer, and I can give you the exact YAML snippet and ingestion pipeline steps to wire it up.

Great choice—using an **ActionType** for `RequestValidation` to capture all the metadata of the request, **plus** driving your `IntegrationGate` entries, gives you both behavioral auditability and process‑milestone visibility. Here’s the recipe:

---

### 1. Define the `RequestValidation` ActionType

```yaml
# Filename: request_validation_action.yml
actionType: yourns.RequestValidation
label: Request Validation
description: |
  A user’s request to push a specific model version into the validation environment.

properties:
  - name: requestId
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Unique key for this validation request.
  - name: requestedOn
    type: datetime
    required: true
    description: Timestamp when the request was submitted.
  - name: requestedBy
    type: string
    required: true
    description: User who submitted the validation request.
  - name: status
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Current state of the request.
    enum:
      - Pending
      - Approved
      - Rejected
  - name: processedOn
    type: datetime
    description: Timestamp when the request was approved or rejected.
  - name: processedBy
    type: string
    description: Admin who processed the request.
  - name: comments
    type: string
    description: Optional notes or reason for rejection.

links:
  - name: caseRef
    targetType: yourns.IntegrationCase
    cardinality: ONE
    description: Case under which this request was made.
  - name: modelRef
    targetType: yourns.ModelVersion
    cardinality: ONE
    description: The model version to push to validation.
```

1. **Import** this YAML into Ontology Builder.
2. **Ingest** a CSV or pipeline to create sample `RequestValidation` actions:

   ```csv
   requestId,requestedOn,requestedBy,status,caseRef.caseId,modelRef.modelVersionId
   RV-001,2025-07-28T12:00:00Z,alice@example.com,Pending,CASE-100,MODEL-1.0.0
   ```
3. **Verify** in the Action Explorer that you see your pending requests.

---

### 2. Wire Actions to Gates

When an action transitions to **Approved**, automatically create or update your `IntegrationGate`:

1. **In Ontology Builder**, under **RequestValidation** → **Action Handlers**, configure a handler on status change:

   * **Trigger**: `status == Approved`
   * **Handler Logic**:

     * If a gate with `name = ValidationPushed` and `caseRef = this.caseRef` already exists, **update** its `status → Passed` and `gateDate → processedOn`.
     * Else, **create** a new `IntegrationGate` instance with:

       ```yaml
       gateId: auto‑generated
       name: ValidationPushed
       status: Passed
       gateDate: {{ processedOn }}
       approver: {{ processedBy }}
       caseRef: {{ caseRef }}
       ```
2. **Similarly**, you can create a gate entry for the original request:

   * On `Pending`, **create** a `IntegrationGate` with `name = ValidationRequested`, `status = Pending`, `gateDate = requestedOn`, `approver = requestedBy`.

---

### 3. Ingest & Test the Workflow

1. **Submit** a new `RequestValidation` action (status=Pending).
2. **Check** that a gate **ValidationRequested** appears under your case.
3. **Update** the action’s status to **Approved** (and fill `processedOn` & `processedBy`).
4. **Verify** both:

   * The **ValidationRequested** gate moves to `Passed` (or stays Pending, per your preference),
   * The **ValidationPushed** gate is created (or updated) with the correct timestamps and approver.

---

### Benefits

* **RequestValidation** captures who asked for validation and when—plus comments or rejection reasons.
* **IntegrationGate** entries give you a timeline of process milestones in your Ontology Explorer and dashboards.
* **Action Handlers** keep your gates in sync automatically—no manual pipeline required once configured.

---

Let me know if you’d like the exact step‑by‑step “Action Handler” configuration in the Foundry UI, or if you’d like to refine any of the gate names, statuses, or handler logic!

Great—let’s take it one step at a time.

---

## Step 1: Define the `RequestValidation` ActionType

1. **Prepare the YAML**

   Create a file named `request_validation_action.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   actionType: yourns.RequestValidation
   label: Request Validation
   description: |
     A user’s request to push a specific model version into the validation environment.

   properties:
     - name: requestId
       type: string
       required: true
       description: Unique key for this validation request.
     - name: requestedOn
       type: datetime
       required: true
       description: Timestamp when the request was submitted.
     - name: requestedBy
       type: string
       required: true
       description: User who submitted the validation request.
     - name: status
       type: string
       required: true
       description: Current state of the request.
       enum:
         - Pending
         - Approved
         - Rejected
     - name: processedOn
       type: datetime
       description: Timestamp when the request was approved or rejected.
     - name: processedBy
       type: string
       description: Admin who processed the request.
     - name: comments
       type: string
       description: Optional notes or reason for rejection.

   links:
     - name: caseRef
       targetType: yourns.IntegrationCase
       cardinality: ONE
       description: Case under which this request was made.
     - name: modelRef
       targetType: yourns.ModelVersion
       cardinality: ONE
       description: The model version to push to validation.
   ```

2. **Import into Foundry**

   * Open Foundry’s **Ontology Builder**.
   * Click **Import → Upload YAML/JSON**, select `request_validation_action.yml` and confirm.
   * Verify that you now see `Request Validation` listed under your Action Types.

Once you’ve imported the action type, let me know and we’ll move on to ingesting a sample request.
