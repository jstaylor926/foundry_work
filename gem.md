Of course. Based on the provided documentation, here is a recommended approach for structuring and starting the build process in Foundry to streamline your MPVal deployment workflow.

This plan focuses on starting with a small, high-impact proof of concept centered on the model integrator's tasks, while establishing a strong foundation that can be scaled later.

### **Phase 1: Define the Core Ontology Objects**

Your goal is to create a "single pane of glass" for the integration process. The best way to start is by defining the central object that connects everything else.

#### **1. The `IntegrationCase` as the Central Hub**

Start with the `IntegrationCase` object. Think of this as the main folder for a specific model integration. It will link together all related tasks, requests, artifacts, and statuses.

* **Action:** Use the provided `integration_case.yml` file to define this object type in the Foundry Ontology Builder.
* **Key Properties to Include:**
    * `caseId`: A unique identifier.
    * `status`: To track progress (e.g., `InProgress`, `Blocked`, `Complete`).
    * `phase`: To denote the lifecycle stage, such as `Validation`.
    * `modelRef`: A **link** to the `ModelVersion` object being deployed.
    * `partnerRef`: A **link** to the `Partner` object.

---

#### **2. Model the MPVal Workflow with an Action and a Gate**

To specifically address the MPVal deployment process, you should model both the *request* for validation and the *milestone* of it being pushed. The documents suggest a powerful pattern: combining a formal **Action** with an **IntegrationGate**.

* **`RequestValidation` Action:** This captures the "who" and "when" of a validation request. It's a formal, auditable event.
    * **Action:** Import the `request_validation_action.yml` file into the Ontology Builder. This creates a new `ActionType`.
    * **Key Links:** This action will link to the `IntegrationCase` it belongs to and the specific `ModelVersion` being validated.

* **`IntegrationGate` Object:** This represents the formal checkpoints in your process.
    * **Action:** Import the `integration_gate.yml` file.
    * **How it Works:** You will create instances of this object with names like "ValidationRequested" and "ValidationPushed". Their status (`Pending`, `Passed`, `Failed`) will provide an at-a-glance view of the process timeline.

This dual approach gives you a rich audit trail (the Action) and a simple, visual milestone tracker (the Gate).

---

#### **3. Add Essential Supporting Objects**

To make the proof-of-concept functional, include these supporting objects from your provided YAML files:

* **`IntegrationTask`:** To break down the work required for the case (e.g., "Prepare validation data," "Run security scan").
* **`ModelVersion`:** To have a clear reference to the model artifact being deployed, including its version number and name.
* **`Partner`:** To associate the integration with the correct internal or external team.
* **`Artifact`:** To link to evidence, such as validation reports, logs, or model binaries.

---

### **Phase 2: Implement the Proof of Concept in Foundry**

Once the object types are defined, you can bring them to life.

#### **1. Ingest Sample Data**

Create small CSV files with sample data for each of your objects and ingest them into Foundry. This will create the underlying datasets for your object types. For example, to test the workflow, you could create a `RequestValidation` action:

| requestId | requestedOn | requestedBy | status | caseRef.caseId | modelRef.modelVersionId |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `RV-001` | `2025-07-28T12:00:00Z` | `alice@example.com` | `Pending` | `CASE-100` | `MODEL-1.0.0` |

*This example is drawn directly from the guidance in `mpval_integration.md`.*

#### **2. Configure an Action Handler (Automation)**

This is a key step to show the power of an ontology-driven workflow.

* **Action:** In the Ontology Builder, configure an **Action Handler** on the `RequestValidation` action.
* **Logic:**
    1.  Set a **trigger** for when the action's `status` changes to `Approved`.
    2.  The handler logic should then automatically find the related `IntegrationGate` (where `name` is "ValidationPushed") and update its `status` to `Passed`.

This automation reduces manual work and ensures your process milestones are always in sync with the actions being taken.

#### **3. Build a Workshop Dashboard**

The ultimate goal is to give integrators a single view. Use **Workshop** to build a simple "IntegrationCase Detail View" dashboard.

* **Layout:** Use the wireframe from `model_int_dev.md` as your guide.
* **Widgets:**
    * A **Header** with the case status, owner, and key dates.
    * A **Task List** showing all `IntegrationTask` objects linked to the case.
    * A **Gate Progress Tracker** to visualize the status of the `IntegrationGate` objects.
    * A list of linked **Artifacts** and **Risks**.

This dashboard is fed directly by your ontology. When data is updated (e.g., the Action Handler updates a Gate), the dashboard reflects the change in real-time.

---

### **Phase 3: Prepare the Presentation**

Your provided documents contain the perfect material for a compelling slide deck.

1.  **The "Why" - Business Value:** Use the content from `business_value.md` and the `executive_summary.md`. Focus on the three key benefits: **visibility**, **control**, and **scalability**. The table in the executive summary is perfect for a high-level overview slide.

2.  **The "What" - The Ontology Model:** Use the text diagram from `model_int_dev.md` to show how `IntegrationCase` connects to its supporting objects. This clearly illustrates the data model.

3.  **The "How" - The Live Demo:**
    * Show the **Workshop dashboard** you built.
    * Submit a new **`RequestValidation`** action from within the dashboard.
    * Approve the action and show how the **`IntegrationGate`** status changes automatically on the timeline. This is a powerful demonstration of the automated workflow.

4.  **The "Wow" - The Future Vision:**
    * Briefly mention that this ontology is the foundation for an **AIP Copilot**. Use the examples from `prompt_templates.md` to show how users could ask natural language questions like, "What's the status of integration case IC-2025-034?".
    * Explain that this model can be extended to the full partner lifecycle (Onboarding, Run, Offboarding) as detailed in `onboarding_ontology.md`, demonstrating the solution's scalability.

By following this plan, you will have a robust, functional proof of concept that directly addresses the needs of the model integrator and a compelling narrative to showcase its value to business owners.

Of course. Here is the OpenAPI-style documentation for the Ontology objects, actions, and their relationships.

This documentation describes the data model for the MPVal deployment process, designed to be used within the Palantir Foundry ecosystem.

MPVal Deployment Ontology: API & Developer Guide
Version: 1.0

Welcome, developer! This guide provides everything you need to understand and interact with the MPVal Deployment Process Ontology in Palantir Foundry.

The purpose of this ontology is to create a digital twin of the model integration lifecycle. By treating concepts like "integration cases," "validation requests," and "milestones" as structured objects, we can automate workflows, provide clear visibility to stakeholders, and build powerful operational applications.

Core Concepts
The data model is built around one central object and one key event:

IntegrationCase: This is the central hub or "folder" for a single model integration project. Everything related to integrating a specific model version from a specific partner is linked to this object.

RequestValidation (Action): This is the primary event that kicks off the MPVal workflow. It's a formal, auditable record of a model integrator asking for a model to be validated. Think of it as the main "POST" request in our system.

Authentication
All interactions with ontology objects and actions are governed by Palantir Foundry's permission model. Authentication is handled implicitly by the platform based on the logged-in user's roles and permissions.

Objects Reference
These are the core data structures you will work with.

1. IntegrationCase
The IntegrationCase is the top-level object that contains all other related information for a single integration effort.

Actions Reference
Actions are the "verbs" of the ontology. They represent user-initiated events that can modify object properties and trigger automation.

POST /requestValidation
Submits a model for the validation process. This is the starting point for the MPVal workflow. When a user triggers this action, it creates a permanent, auditable record of the request.

Parameters

Parameter

Type

Required

Description

caseId

string

Yes

The ID of the IntegrationCase this request belongs to.

modelVersionId

string

Yes

The ID of the ModelVersion to be validated.

requestedBy

string

Yes

The email of the user making the request.

Example Usage

A user in a Workshop application would fill out a form that, upon submission, executes this action with the following payload:

{
  "caseId": "CASE-2025-015",
  "modelVersionId": "PARTNER_X_MODEL-2.1.0",
  "requestedBy": "j.taylor@airbus.com"
}

Downstream Effects

An auditable action log is created.

Automation Trigger: This action can be configured to automatically find the IntegrationGate named ValidationRequested (linked to the same caseId) and update its status from Pending to Passed.

Example Workflow: A Day in the Life
Setup: A new IntegrationCase object is created for Partner-Y's new MODEL-ABC-3.0. Several IntegrationGate objects are automatically linked to it, including one named ValidationRequested with a status of Pending.

Request: An Airbus model integrator opens a Workshop application for the IntegrationCase. They click a "Request Validation" button, which triggers the requestValidation action.

Automation: The action runs. An Action Handler, listening for successful executions of requestValidation, immediately finds the ValidationRequested gate and updates its status to Passed.

Visibility: On the Workshop dashboard, the timeline view for the IntegrationCase now visually shows the ValidationRequested milestone as complete. Everyone involved sees the progress in real-time without any manual updates.
